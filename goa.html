                <h2>There are two different ways of visiting the Dudhsagar waterfalls:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trek to the Dudhsagar waterfalls-most popular in the monsoon months (June to September).</li>
                    <li>Jeep safari to the Dudhsagar waterfalls-starts post-monsoon (typically operates from October end
                        to May).</li>
                </ul>

                            The Dudhsagar waterfalls (Dudh: milk, Sagar: sea) are located on the Goa-Karnataka border.
                            They are part of the Western
                            Ghats - a mountain range in Southwest India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a four-tiered waterfall with different ways to reach each level. The mountains from
                            which the Dudhsagar waterfalls
                            emerge are in Karnataka and the forest in which they fall is in Goa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The base of these waterfalls is in the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary in the Mollem
                            district of South Goa. It is a
                            lush green sanctuary, characteristic to the forests of the Western Ghats.

                        Because they straddle the two states of Goa and Karnataka, and because they are so big (they are
                        among the highest waterfalls
                        in India), there are multiple ways to reach the Dudhsagar waterfalls.

                            <h4>How to reach Dudhsagar waterfalls by train?</h4>

                            <ul>
                                <li>You can take the train to the Dudhsagar waterfalls either from the Goa side or the
                                    Karnataka side.</li>
                                <li>
                                    If you are travelling from Mumbai/Pune/Goa, you will have to reach Kulem for
                                    visiting the Dudhsagar waterfalls. The trains
                                    to reach the Dudhsagar waterfalls while travelling from Mumbai/Pune/Goa are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The <b>Amravati Express</b> or <b>Goa Express</b> from Pune to Kulem.</li>
                                        <li>The Vasco-Kulem Daily Passenger runs every day from Madgaon/ Vasco in Goa to
                                            Kulem. If you are already in Goa, go
                                            to the Madgaon or Vasco railway stations and board this train.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Dudhsagar waterfalls are not directly accessible by road, which means you can not drive
                            your car all the way to the
                            Dudhsagar waterfalls.</li>
                        <li>You will have to drive up to Kulem. From Kulem you can either trek to the Dudhsagar
                            waterfalls or take a jeep safari via
                            the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary.</li>
                        <li>The parking lot in Kulem is a 2-minute walk from the Kulem Railway station.</li>
                        <li>If you are driving down from Pune or Mumbai, you can take the national highway 48 to
                            Belgaum. Then get off the highway and
                            drive towards Mollem via Khanapur.</li>

                <h2><u>Trek to Dudhsagar waterfalls</u></h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>In Goa, your trek to the Dudhsagar waterfalls will start by climbing up the railway tracks from
                        Kulem. You will climb up the
                        Braganza ghat, crossing several tunnels and reach the Dudhsagar waterfalls. The trekking
                        distance from Kulem to the Dudhsagar
                        waterfalls is 11 km. It is a slightly uphill walk.</li>
                    <li>If you start in Karnataka, you will trek over the railway tracks from Castle Rock. The trekking
                        distance from Castle Rock
                        to the Dudhsagar waterfalls is roughly 14 km.</li>
                    <li>You can get off the Amravati Express at Sonalium which is an unscheduled stop. At Sonalium, you
                        will have to climb down the
                        ladder and jump off the train. There is no platform here. From Sonalium you have to walk roughly
                        3 km to reach Dudhsagar
                        waterfalls.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><u>Start of the trek to Dudhsagar waterfalls</u></h4>

                <p>It's fun walking through this section of the railway tracks in the middle of the forest through
                    numerous tunnels. But you have to
                    be mindful the whole while to the sound of approaching trains. By trekking over the railway tracks,
                    you reach the middle tier of
                    the Dudhsagar waterfalls.</p><br>
                <p>The railway tracks trace a horseshoe (U) over the valley approaching the Dudhsagar waterfalls. The
                    first glimpse of the waterfalls
                    is, hence, from across the valley.</p><br>
                <p>Our guide knew the exact point at which we would see the waterfalls. When the train got there, he
                    started shouting “camera ready,
                    viewpoint, viewpoint”.</p><br>
                <p>We readied our cameras. The train slowly (and extremely steadily) approached the viewpoint - and we
                    froze. We just couldn't take
                    our eyes off the majestic Dudhsagar waterfalls. At that moment, we couldn't care about the camera,
                    the photograph, the viewpoint
                    or anything else.</p><br>

                <h4><u>Trekking to the pool at the base of Dudhsagar waterfalls</u></h4>
                <p>At this point, you can trek down from the tracks into the forest of the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife
                    Sanctuary. Companies which offer
                    trek to Dudhsagar waterfalls, often take this route. Through the forest, you reach the bottom tier
                    of these waterfalls. You can
                    return to Kulem via the forest route.</p>

                <h4><u>You can combine trek and travel by train to reach Dudhsagar waterfalls</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dudhsagar Railway station is part of the Southwest Railway division of the Indian Railways.
                        Passenger trains do not stop at Dudhsagar railway station. There is no platform here. You can
                        get off the train only if the
                        train gets a signal at Dudhsagar. You will then need to climb down the ladder and jump onto the
                        ground.
                        Words of caution: You need to be fit enough to jump off the train directly on the railway
                        tracks. Travelling with babies or
                        dependent seniors is a strict no-no.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you manage to get off at the Dudhsagar railway station, you will have to walk back for around
                        1 km to reach the waterfalls.
                        Be warned: Boarding and deboarding at the Dudhsagar railway station are officially not allowed
                        by the Railway Police. </li>
                    <li>If you take the Amravati Express or the Vasco Kulem passenger in the morning, you can easily
                        return to Madgaon by boarding
                        the Amravati Express from Sonalium (doesn't operate on Sundays).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2><u>Rules about trekking to Dudhsagar waterfalls through the railway tracks</u></h2><br>
                <p>
                    Before we go ahead, read this:
                    Walking on the railway tracks is banned by the Railway Police. You are officially not allowed to
                    access the Dudhsagar waterfalls
                    through the railway tracks
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the ban was put in place, we have received contradictory feedback from our readers who visited
                    the Dudhsagar waterfalls
                    individually. While some managed to easily walk over the railway tracks, others were stopped by the
                    Railway Police and forced
                    to turn back.
                    We have also heard narrations of Railway Police standing near the Dudhsagar waterfalls in the
                    monsoon and ensuring no one gets
                    off the train.
                </p>

                <h2>What else is to see in the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary besides the Dudhsagar waterfalls?</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>While there are several smaller waterfalls particularly just after the monsoon, another bigger
                        waterfall is the Tambdi Surla.</li>
                    <li>It is within the Mollem National Park of which the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary is a part.
                        However, it is far from the
                        Dudhsagar waterfalls and clubbing the two waterfalls in a day will not be possible.</li>
                    <li>Another interesting feature inside the sanctuary and actually close to the Dudhsagar waterfalls
                        is the Devil's Canyon. Even
                        though it is en route, having a strict schedule means that your jeep driver will not halt at the
                        Devil's Canyon.</li>
                    <li>We recommend hiring a local guide and planning a separate visit than the jeep safari to the
                        Dudhsagar waterfalls. The guide
                        can take you to the Tambdi Surla waterfalls as well as the Devil's Canyon.</li>
